# gatsby-source-gravityforms

This plugin connects to a WordPress Gravity Forms install. It finds all active forms and settings and adds them to the Gatsby nodes.

It uses 0Auth 1.0a Authentication for a higher level of security.

## Installation

```js
# Install the plugin
yarn add gatsby-source-gravityforms

# Or with NPM
npm i gatsby-source-gravityforms
```

Add to `gatsby-config.js`:

### Default Setup

```js
module.exports = {
    plugins: [
        {
            resolve: 'gatsby-source-gravityforms',
            options: {
                // Base URL needs to include protocol (http/https)
                baseUrl: 'SITE_BASE_URL',
                include: [], // Array of form IDs. Will only import these forms.
                exclude: [], // Array of form IDs. Will exclude these forms.
                // Gravity Forms API
                allowSelfSigned: false
                api: {
                    key: 'CONSUMER_KEY',
                    secret: 'CONSUMER_SECRET',
                },
            },
        },
    ],
}
```

Remember to store secret keys/important data as _environment variables_ and _not_ in client side code.

### All Options

```js
module.exports = {
    plugins: [
        {
            resolve: 'gatsby-source-gravityforms',
            options: {
                // Base URL needs to include protocol (http/https)
                baseUrl: 'SITE_BASE_URL',
                // Gravity Forms API
                api: {
                    key: 'CONSUMER_KEY',
                    secret: 'CONSUMER_SECRET',
                },
                //Set to true to enable selfsigned certs in development mode
                allowSelfSigned: false
                // Basic Auth
                basicAuth: {
                    username: 'USERNAME',
                    password: 'PASSWORD',
                },
                ignoreFields: [
                    // Top level fields within the Gravity Forms return
                    // to ignore.
                    // Default ignore is 'notifications'. To keep this
                    // as set, remove the ignoreFields setting from here.
                    // If adding more fields, you will need to include
                    // notifications to ensure it is ignored.
                ],
            },
        },
    ],
}
```

## Gravity Forms REST API Settings

### Step by step - How to connect

To use the Gravity Forms REST API, it needs to be enabled within the Gravity Forms Settings. This is found under "General Settings".

Once "Enable access to the API" has been checked, Gravity Forms will give you the ability to create API keys. These two keys (consumer & secret) are the keys required in the gatsby-config.js file as key & secret.

It is recommended to create one API key for use with this Source Plugin, set to Read access only. Then if Write access is required to submit the forms, create a separate one.

### Basic Auth

Your backend API may be set up with Basic Auth in place. This is added to the beginning of the URL so 0auth1 can also run in tandem. Setup is shown above in Installation.

## How To Query

A recommended data set can be extracted from GraphQL using the following query:

```js
{
    allGfForm {
        edges {
            node {
                formId
                slug
                apiURL
                descriptionPlacement
                formFields {
                    id
                    label
                    labelPlacement
                    description
                    descriptionPlacement
                    type
                    choices
                    content //remove if not using HTML Content
                    errorMessage
                    inputMaskValue
                    isRequired
                    visibility
                    cssClass
                    placeholder
                    size
                    defaultValue
                    maxLength
                    conditionalLogic
                    emailConfirmEnabled
                    enableOtherChoice
                }
                button {
                    text
                }
                confirmations {
                    message
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This will return each form set up in Gravity Forms. It will include:

-   Slug of the form title
-   The backend form REST API URL
-   All form fields
-   Button info
-   Confirmation info

Currently "choices" in formFields is stringified and will need to be parsed when extracted. This is due to Gatsby seemingly not seeing this many level deep.

## Using the Data

The second step to all this is parsing the data, it needs to be displayed. With a few more steps outlined in the component below, Gravity Forms will be completely connected to your static site.

It is still a WIP, but feel free to help develop it/use as it is.

## Development / Testing

If you are interested in helping progress the plugin, please do! Although it works, there is still a lot to do.

### Cache

when developing, remember to clear the cache as you work on the plugin. Gatsby is very effective in making building a site quickly, but it does not help when trying to work out issues. Clear the cache whenever you make a content/query change.
